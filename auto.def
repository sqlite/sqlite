# This is the main autosetup-compatible configure script for the
# SQLite project.
#
# This script and all of its dependencies must be kept compatible with
# JimTCL, a copy of which is included in this source tree as
# ./autosetup/jimsh0.c. The number of incompatibilities between
# canonical TCL and JimTCL is very low and alternative formulations of
# incompatible constructs have, so far, been easy to find.
