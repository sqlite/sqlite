# sqlite3RollbackAll() loops through all attached b-trees and rolls
# back each one separately.  Then if the SQLITE_InternChanges flag is
# set, it resets the schema.  Both of the above steps must be done
# while holding a mutex, otherwise another thread might slip in and
# try to use the new schema with the old data.
#
# The following sequence of tests attempt to verify that the actions
# taken by sqlite3RollbackAll() are thread-atomic (that they cannot be
# interrupted by a separate thread.)  
#
# Note that a TCL interpreter can only be used within the thread in which
# it was originally created (because it uses thread-local-storage).  
# The tvfs callbacks must therefore only run on the main thread.  
# There is some trickery in the read_callback procedure to ensure that
# this is the case.
