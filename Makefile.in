# Makefile for SQLITE
#
# This makefile is intended to be configured automatically using the
# configure script. Hand editing may not work as expected because
# certain blocks are added or removed depending on configure-time
# information.

#XX# Lines starting with #XX# are TODOs for the port to autosetup.
#
# Known TODOs/FIXMEs/TOIMPROVEs for the autosetup port, in no
# particular order...
#
# - libreadline detection and handling of its -I, -L, and -l flags.
# These can vary considerably across systems. e.g. some need -lncurses,
# and some don't know what an -lncurses is.
#
# - TEA pieces.
#
# - Replace the autotools-specific distribution deliverable(s).
#
# - Provide Makefile.msc, Makefile.linux-gcc, and any required similar
# makefile stubs for environments where the configure script will not
# run. The core makefile rules in main.mk "should" apply as-is for
# most platforms.  We can potentially generate those makefiles, along
# with main.mk, like we do in the Fossil project.
#
# - Confirm whether cross-compilation works and patch it
# appropriately.

# Maintenance reminder: When using the X?=Y variable assignment
# formulation, please test the build with both GNU make and a POSIX
# make (e.g. BSD make, a.k.a. bmake). On at least one occassion, that
# formulation has led to inconsistent behavior between the two major
# make flavors when used with variable names which might sensibly be
# in the developer's environment (namely CC).
