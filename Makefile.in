# Makefile for SQLITE

# This makefile is intended to be configured automatically using the
# configure script.

# The docs for many of its variables are in the primary static
# makefile, main.mk (which this one includes at runtime).

#
# Known TODOs/FIXMEs/TOIMPROVEs for the autosetup port, in no
# particular order...
#
# - TEA pieces.
#
# - Replace the autotools-specific distribution deliverable(s).
#
# - Confirm whether cross-compilation works and patch it
# appropriately.
#
# Maintenance reminders:
#
# - This makefile should remain as POSIX-make-compatible as possible:
#   https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/make.html
#
# - The naming convention of some vars, using periods instead of
#   underscores, though unconventional, was selected for a couple of
#   reasons: 1) Personal taste (for which there is no accounting).  2)
#   It is thought to help defend against inadvertent injection of
#   those vars via environment variables (because X.Y is not a legal
#   environment variable name).  "Feature or bug?" is debatable and
#   this naming convention may be reverted if it causes any grief.

# that contains this "Makefile.in" and the "configure" script.

# Autotools-conventional vars which are used by package installation
# rules in main.mk. To get sane handling when a user overrides only
# a subset of these, we perform some acrobatics with these vars
# in the configure script: see [proj-remap-autoconf-dir-vars] for
# full details.
#
# For completeness's sake, the aforementioned conventional vars which
# are relevant to our installation rules are:
#
# datadir     = $(prefix)/share
# mandir      = $(datadir)/man
# includedir  = $(prefix)/include
# exec_prefix = $(prefix)
# bindir      = $(exec_prefix)/bin

#
# Our builds do not require any of their relatives:
#
# sbindir        = $(exec_prefix)/sbin
# sysconfdir     = /etc
# sharedstatedir = $(prefix)/com
# localstatedir  = /var
# runstatedir    = /run

# $(CFLAGS) is problematic because it is frequently overridden when
# invoking make, which loses things like -fPIC. So... we avoid using
# it directly and instead add a level of indirection.  We combine
# $(CFLAGS) and $(CPPFLAGS) here because that's the way the legacy
# build did it and many builds rely on that. See main.mk for more
# details.
#
# Historical note: the pre-3.48 build only honored CPPFLAGS at
# configure-time, and expanded them into the generated Makefile. There
# are, in that build, no uses of CPPFLAGS in the configure-expanded
# Makefile. Ergo: if a client configures with CPPFLAGS=... and then
# explicitly passes CFLAGS=... to make, the CPPFLAGS will be
# lost. That behavior is retained in 3.48+.
