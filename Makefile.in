# Makefile for SQLITE
#
# This makefile is intended to be configured automatically using the
# configure script. Hand editing may not work as expected because
# certain blocks are added or removed depending on configure-time
# information.
#
# The docs for many of its variables are in the primary static
# makefile, main.mk (which this one includes at runtime).

########################################################################
#
# Known TODOs/FIXMEs/TOIMPROVEs for the autosetup port, in no
# particular order...
#
# - libreadline detection and handling of its -I, -L, and -l flags.
# These can vary considerably across systems. e.g. some need -lncurses,
# and some don't know what an -lncurses is.
#
# - TEA pieces.
#
# - Replace the autotools-specific distribution deliverable(s).
#
# - Confirm whether cross-compilation works and patch it
# appropriately.
#
# Maintenance reminders:
#
# - This makefile should remain as POSIX-make-compatible as possible:
#   https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/make.html
#
# - When using the X?=Y variable assignment formulation, please test
#   the build with both GNU make and a POSIX make (e.g. BSD make,
#   a.k.a. bmake). On at least one occassion, that formulation has led
#   to inconsistent behavior between the two major make flavors when
#   used with variable names which might sensibly be in the
#   developer's environment (namely CC).
#
# - The naming convention of some vars, using periods instead of
#   underscores, though unconventional, was selected for a couple of
#   reasons: 1) Personal taste (for which there is no accounting).  2)
#   It is thought to help defend against inadvertent injection of
#   those vars via environment variables (because X.Y is not a legal
#   environment variable name).  "Feature or bug?" is debatable and
#   this naming convention may be reverted if it causes any grief.
