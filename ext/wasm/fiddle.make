# Explanation of the emcc build flags follows. Full docs for these can
# be found at:
#
#  https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/src/settings.js
#
# -sENVIRONMENT=web: elides bootstrap code related to non-web JS
#  environments like node.js. Removing this makes the output a tiny
#  tick larger but hypothetically makes it more portable to
#  non-browser JS environments.
#
# -sMODULARIZE: changes how the generated code is structured to avoid
#  declaring a global Module object and instead installing a function
#  which loads and initializes the module. The function is named...
#
# -sEXPORT_NAME=jsFunctionName (see -sMODULARIZE)
#
# -sEXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS=@/absolute/path/to/file: a file
#  containing a list of emscripten-supplied APIs, one per line, which
#  must be exported into the generated JS. Must be an absolute path!
#
# -sEXPORTED_FUNCTIONS=@/absolute/path/to/file: a file containing a
#  list of C functions, one per line, which must be exported via wasm
#  so they're visible to JS. C symbols names in that file must all
#  start with an underscore for reasons known only to the emcc
#  developers. e.g., _sqlite3_open_v2 and _sqlite3_finalize. Must be
#  an absolute path!
#
# -sSTRICT_JS ensures that the emitted JS code includes the 'use
#  strict' option. Note that -sSTRICT is more broadly-scoped and
#  results in build errors.
#
# -sALLOW_TABLE_GROWTH is required for (at a minimum) the UDF-binding
#  feature. Without it, JS functions cannot be made to proxy C-side
#  callbacks.
#
# -sABORTING_MALLOC causes the JS-bound _malloc() to abort rather than
#  return 0 on OOM. If set to 0 then all code which uses _malloc()
#  must, just like in C, check the result before using it, else
#  they're likely to corrupt the JS/WASM heap by writing to its
#  address of 0. It is, as of this writing, enabled in Emscripten by
#  default but we enable it explicitly in case that default changes.
#
# -sDYNAMIC_EXECUTION=0 disables eval() and the Function constructor.
#  If the build runs without these, it's preferable to use this flag
#  because certain execution environments disallow those constructs.
#  This flag is not strictly necessary, however.
#
# --no-entry: for compiling library code with no main(). If this is
#  not supplied and the code has a main(), it is called as part of the
#  module init process. Note that main() is #if'd out of shell.c
#  (renamed) when building in wasm mode.
#
# --pre-js/--post-js=FILE relative or absolute paths to JS files to
#  prepend/append to the emcc-generated bootstrapping JS. It's
#  easier/faster to develop with separate JS files (reduces rebuilding
#  requirements) but certain configurations, namely -sMODULARIZE, may
#  require using at least a --pre-js file. They can be used
#  individually and need not be paired.
#
# -O0..-O3 and -Oz: optimization levels affect not only C-style
#  optimization but whether or not the resulting generated JS code
#  gets minified. -O0 compiles _much_ more quickly than -O3 or -Oz,
#  and doesn't minimize any JS code, so is recommended for
#  development. -O3 or -Oz are recommended for deployment, but
#  primarily because -Oz will shrink the wasm file notably. JS-side
#  minification makes little difference in terms of overall
#  distributable size.
#
# --minify 0: supposedly disables minification of the generated JS
#  code, regardless of optimization level, but that's not quite true:
#  search the main makefile for wasm-strip for details. Minification
#  of the JS has minimal overall effect in the larger scheme of things
#  and results in JS files which can neither be edited nor viewed as
#  text files in Fossil (which flags them as binary because of their
#  extreme line lengths). Interestingly, whether or not the comments
#  in the generated JS file get stripped is unaffected by this setting
#  and depends entirely on the optimization level. Higher optimization
#  levels reduce the size of the JS considerably even without
#  minification.
