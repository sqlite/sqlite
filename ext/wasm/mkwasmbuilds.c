** sqlite3's canonical WASM build. The main motivation is to generate
** code which "could" be created via GNU Make's eval command but is
** highly illegible when constructed that way. Attempts to write this
** app in Bash and TCL have suffered from the problem that those
** languages require escaping $ symbols, making the resulting script
** code as illegible as the eval spaghetti we want to get away
** from. Maintaining it in C is, somewhat surprisingly, _slightly_
** less illegible than writing it in bash, tcl, or native Make code.
**
** The emitted makefile code is not standalone - it depends on
** variables and $(call)able functions from the main makefile.

** Info needed for building one concrete JS/WASM combination..
**
** Notes about Emscripten builds...
**
** When emcc processes X.js it also generates X.wasm and hard-codes
** the name "X.wasm" into the JS file (it has to - there's no reliable
** way to derive that name at runtime for certain modes of loading the
** WASM file). Because we only need two sqlite3.wasm files (one each
** for 32- and 64-bit), the build then copies just those into the
** final build directory $(dir.dout).
**
** To keep parallel builds from stepping on each other, each distinct
** build goes into its own subdir $(dir.dout.BuildName)[^1], i.e.
** $(dir.dout)/BuildName.  Builds which produce deliverables we'd like
** to keep/distribute copy their final results into the build dir
** $(dir.dout). See the notes for the CP_JS enum entry for more
** details on that.
**
** The final result of each build is a pair of JS/WASM files, but
** getting there requires generation of several files, primarily as
** inputs for specific Emscripten flags:
**
** --pre-js = file gets injected after Emscripten's earliest starting
** point, enabling limited customization of Emscripten's
** behavior. This code lives/runs within the generated sqlite3InitModule().
**
** --post-js = gets injected after Emscripten's main work, but still
** within the body of sqlite3InitModule().
**
** --extern-pre-js = gets injected before sqlite3InitModule(), in the
** global scope. We inject the license and version info here.
**
** --extern-post-js = gets injected immediately after
** sqlite3InitModule(), in the global scope. In this step we replace
** sqlite3InitModule() with a slightly customized, the main purpose of
** which is to (A) give us (not Emscripten) control over the arguments
** it accepts and (B) to run the library bootstrap step.
**
** Then there's sqlite3-api.BuildName.js, which is the entire SQLite3
** JS API (generated from the list defined in $(sqlite3-api.jses)). It
** gets sandwitched inside --post-js.
**
** Each of those inputs has to be generated before passing them on to
** Emscripten so that any build-specific capabilities can get filtered
** in or out (using ./c-pp.c).
**
