#
# This makefile is part of the teaish framework, a tool for building
# Tcl extensions, conceptually related to TEA/tclconfig but using the
# Autosetup configuration system instead of the GNU Autotools.
#
# A copy of this makefile gets processed for each extension separately
# and populated with info about how to build, test, and install the
# extension.
#
# Maintenance reminder: this file needs to stay portable with POSIX
# Make, not just GNU Make. Yes, that's unfortunate because it makes
# some things impossible (like skipping over swathes of rules when
# 'make distclean' is invoked).
